Enterprise IT Asset Risk Analytics Dashboard

Predictive Risk Modeling & Operational Analytics for IT Asset Management

⸻

📌 Business Problem

Large enterprises (e.g., banking institutions) manage thousands of IT assets across departments.
Without proactive monitoring, high-risk assets can lead to:
	•	Operational disruptions
	•	Security vulnerabilities
	•	Compliance issues
	•	Increased maintenance costs

This project builds a data-driven IT Asset Risk Analytics solution to help ITAM teams proactively identify and prioritize high-risk assets.

⸻

🎯 Project Objective

To design an end-to-end analytics solution that:
	•	Identifies high-risk IT assets using machine learning
	•	Enables threshold-based risk sensitivity analysis
	•	Provides interactive Power BI dashboards for operational decision-making
	•	Supports proactive asset governance

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	SQL – Data extraction, joins, transformation
	•	Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) – Feature engineering & predictive modeling
	•	Random Forest Classifier – Risk prediction
	•	Power BI – Interactive dashboards & what-if analysis
	•	Jupyter Notebook – Model development & validation

⸻

📊 Key Features

1️⃣ Risk Prediction Model
	•	Built a Random Forest model to classify assets into High / Medium / Low risk
	•	Engineered features from:
	•	Incident history
	•	Asset age
	•	Patch status
	•	Department usage
	•	Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics

⸻

2️⃣ Threshold Sensitivity Analysis
	•	Implemented adjustable risk threshold logic
	•	Allows IT managers to simulate different risk tolerance levels
	•	Supports proactive vs reactive risk strategies

⸻

3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard provides:
	•	📈 Risk trend over time
	•	🏢 Department-wise risk distribution
	•	💻 High-risk asset listing
	•	🎛️ What-if threshold analysis
	•	📊 Incident correlation analysis

This enables leadership to quickly identify:
	•	Which departments carry highest risk exposure
	•	Which assets require immediate remediation
	•	How risk evolves over time

⸻

📈 Business Impact

This solution demonstrates how predictive analytics can:
	•	Reduce manual asset review effort
	•	Improve prioritization of remediation efforts
	•	Support data-driven IT governance
	•	Enable proactive risk mitigation

The same methodology can be applied to:
	•	Operational risk monitoring in banking
	•	Infrastructure risk analysis
	•	Compliance and audit analytics
